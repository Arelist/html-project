             I study at <strong>Borough of Manhattan Community College (BMCC)</strong>, located in downtown Manhattan, New York City. 
      The campus is modern, diverse, and full of energy — it’s a place where students from all over the world come together to learn and grow. 
      My major is <strong>Computer Science</strong>, and I’m currently taking courses that help me improve my programming, math, and problem-solving skills. 
      BMCC also offers many clubs and activities that allow students to connect, explore their interests, and build a strong community spirit. 
      I really appreciate the supportive environment and the opportunities it gives me to prepare for my future in technology.
        </P>
